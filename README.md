json for minilanguage.com. more to come

I have a passion for languages and was delighted to see that someone created minilanguage.com, which seems a very cool addition to Toki Pona. I created learntoki.com previously but it didn't get as useful as I anticipated. I see minilangauge.com has some quite useful tools already, but couldn't find any way for programmers to start building more tools.

I dont' have time now, but certainly would love to work on this in the future. At least, here is a JSON to get started with doing stuff with its vocab. Maybe other programmers can use it.

Cheers
